Le Juan's recipe book is a group project I developed during my first semester at SLC. It has a focus on ease of use, as its target audience wouldn't be the most 'techâ€“savvy'. The site utilizes queries to load content from JS objects, reducing significantly the code complexity and size of the site. Received a 100% mark.
