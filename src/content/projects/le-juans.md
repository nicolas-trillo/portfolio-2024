Le Juan's recipe book is a group project I developed during my first semester at SLC. It has a focus on ease of use, as its target audience wouldn't be the most 'techâ€“savvy'. This website has only has 6 HTML files and loads the data for its 20 recipes from JS objects. Project received a 25/25 (100%) grade and was recognized as the best submitted in the class.
