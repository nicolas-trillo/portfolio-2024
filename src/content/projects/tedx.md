TEDxYouth@Yanahuara was a conference I organized with the help of a friend in 2022. It had the objective of bringing back TEDx conferences to the city I lived in at the time. The last TEDx there had taken place before the 2020 pandemic, So it was well-welcomed by the local community, and a resounding success. I approached the development of its website with <a href="https://www.solidjs.com" target="_blank">Solid.js</a>.
