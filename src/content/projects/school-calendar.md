The CSJs4a calendar was my first attempt at JavaScript development. The website has the objective of providing each day's class and video call links to students of my grade and class–group during a determined quarter of 2021, making the process of switching between discord and class faster. I developed this website alongside a close friend, and it was maintained for the entirety of the 2021 school year. We stopped maintaining it after our school switched back to in–person classes.
