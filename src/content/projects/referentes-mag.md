The REFERENTES magazine was a project for my Spanish class at school, I utilized the name two times, first in 2021 and later in 2022, hence the '2021 site' link. The magazine talked about a short variety of writers and their works. Two versions of this website exist, both coexisting under the same domain. The 2021 version has a very poor UX, which was the area I improved the most in the second iteration for the 2022 project. Though more classmates participated in the writing, I decided to present the projects in a website, as to stand out from the repetitive power points.
