The current website of GT Arquitectura is the third version the site that I developed for my father's architecture firm. The first two versions were flawed in development, as vanilla HTML and JS failed to produce a scalable website. This was solved by migrating to <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a>. It allowed for the website to be developed in an orderly and scalable manner, that would not be a challenge to modify in the future. This website has a focus around images, its objective being to make the past works of the firm as appealing as possible to potential customers.
